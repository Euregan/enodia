# Enodia

Enodia is a GraphQL client generator for Typescript projects. It generates a
fully typed client file from your GraphQL API, allowing you to have both
automatic types in return of your queries and mutations, and type safety when
providing arguments and fields.

## Installation

As Enodia generates the client file, you can install it as a dev dependency:

```bash
npm install -D enodia
```

For Enodia to work, you will also need to have `ts-node` installed, either as a
dependency in your project, or globally:

```bash
npm install -D ts-node
```

Finally, you will need to setup an `enodia.config.ts` file at the root of your
project. This file should export an object with the following properties:

```typescript
export default {
  scalarTypes: {
    // This is a map of scalar types in your GraphQL schema to Typescript types.
    // For example, if your GraphQL schema has a `Date` scalar type, you can map
    // it to the `Date` type in Typescript.
    Date: { name: "Date" },
  },
};
```

More information on this file in the [configuration section](#configuration).

## Usage

### Generating the client

Once your `enodia.config.ts` file is setup, you can run Enodia either pointing
directly at your GraphQL schema file:

```bash
enodia ./path/to/schema.graphql ./path/to/client.ts
```

Or by providing the URL of your GraphQL API:

```bash
enodia http://localhost:3000/graphql ./path/to/client.ts
```

This will generate a client file at the given path. You should .gitignore the
generated file.

### Using the client

The generated file exports a simple `enodia` function, which takes the URL of
your API as a first parameter. The second parameter is a configuration object,
allowing you to inject a custom `fetch` function. This can be used to handle
authentication, for example. This function will return the instantiated client.
The client has two properties, `query` and `mutation` containing functions to
call every query and mutation your GraphQL API exposes.

## Configuration

### `scalarTypes`

This is a map of scalar types in your GraphQL schema to Typescript types. For
example, if your GraphQL schema has a `Date` scalar type, you can map it to the
`Date` type in Typescript.

```typescript
export default {
  scalarTypes: {
    Date: { name: "Date" },
  },
};
```

If you need to use custom types, you can also provide a `path` property, which
will be used to import the type from the generated client file.

```typescript
export default {
  scalarTypes: {
    Json: { name: "Json", path: "./types" },
  },
};
```

The `name` property is optional when providing a `path`, if the returned type is
the default export of the module.

### `headers`

This is an async function that returns an object containing the headers to send
to the GraphQL API when generating the client. This can be used to handle
authentication, for example. This will not be used if you point to the GraphQL
schema file when running the command.

```typescript
import { getToken } from "./src/auth";

export default {
  headers: async () => {
    const token = await getToken();

    return {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    };
  },
};
```
